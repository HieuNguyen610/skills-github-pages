### I created a blog on github to write about FM2024 save
I am managing Wrexham United in a rag to rich save. But honestly, Wrexham United was a rich club with greate financial support from its ambitious owner. 
When i start to take charge, we was predicted to be 1st in Skybet League 2. I successfully claim the title with record point wins. 
The second season, with additional of some ex-Premier League player, i managed to claim the League One title with record point. 
The third season, the first in Championship, we are now in the 2-nd place with 30 points from 12 matches. Behind Crystal Palace who's player's quality is vastly superior to everyone else from the league.
